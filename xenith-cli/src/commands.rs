//! Xenith main command handler
//!
//! This module contains the main command handler for the Xenith CLI.
//! All subcommands are listed in the [`Commands`] enum with their own
//! arguments.
//!
//! All commands are handled here and dispatched to the appropriate
//! command handler, each in their own module through the [`handle`] function.
//! This allows for easy extensibility and maintainability of the CLI.
