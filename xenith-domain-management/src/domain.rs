//! Xenith domain configuration
//!
//! This module provides a high-level interface for managing Xenith domains.
//! All structures were created following the respective Xen configuration manuals,
//! but not exhaustively. Only the most common options are exposed to the user.
//!
//! This crate does not need to be a second `xl` tool, but it should provide a simple
//! and easy-to-use interface for managing domains on Xenith.
