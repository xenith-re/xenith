//! # xenith-redpill
//!
//! `xenith-redpill` is a collection of different techniques used to identify the presence of a generic hypervisor or **specifically Xen**.
//!
//! Inspired and based on the following resources.
//! - [al-khaser](https://github.com/ayoubfaouzi/al-khaser)
//! - [Hypervisor-Detection](https://github.com/void-stack/Hypervisor-Detection)
//! - [VMDE](https://github.com/hfiref0x/VMDE)
//! - [Pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish)
//! - [VMAware](https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware)
//!
//! TODO: Add other resources that inspired this project.
//!
//! Those projects are great and I recommend you to check them out. This tool is just a collection of different techniques I found interesting and wanted to implement.
//! Note that not every technique comes from those projects, some of them are from other sources that always will be mentioned in the code.
//!
//! This is a continuous work in progress crate and I will keep adding new techniques as I discover them.
