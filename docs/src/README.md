## Project description

Welcome to Xenith, a lightweight and stealthy hypervisor built on top of Xen, designed specifically for research and development in operating systems and virtualization. Our goal is to provide a robust, yet flexible environment for developers and researchers to explore, test, and innovate.

You may now wonder, what makes Xenith special and useful ?

- **Stealth environment**: Xenith is designed with stealth in mind. We're developing a cutting-edge anti-VM framework to ensure your virtualized workloads remain undetected. This is one of the key steps in our project roadmap.
- **Advanced debugging**: Dive deep into your systems with our comprehensive low-level debugging tools. Whether you're troubleshooting, optimizing or reverse engineering, Xenith has you covered.
- **Virtual Machine Introspection** (VMI): Get real-time insights into what's happening inside your guest VMs. This feature is invaluable for monitoring and securing your virtual environments. Hook any function, inspect memory, and more.
- **Powerful scripting API**: Automate your workflows and extend Xenith's capabilities with our robust scripting API. It's designed to be flexible and easy to use.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Debugging and reverse engineering can be complex tasks. Xenith provides a user-friendly GUI to simplify your workflow and make your life easier.
- **Snapshot and restore**: Simplify your testing process with snapshot capabilities. Capture the state of your system and revert back whenever you need to.
- **Open-source collaboration**: We believe in the power of community-driven development. Xenith is open-source, allowing everyone to contribute and innovate together.

## Documentation organization

This documentation tries to follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation structure, which is a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.

Documentation isn’t just one thing, it is made up of four different parts which include — Tutorials, How-to guides, Explanations, and References.

For more information, you can visit the [Diátaxis website](https://diataxis.fr/) or read the [Diátaxis documentation](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/). Also, there is this good article [How to Structure Documentation using the Diataxis Framework](https://medium.com/@techwritershub/how-to-structure-documentation-using-the-diataxis-framework-70d4a5a61db7) from Tech Writers Hub Medium blog.
