This documentation tries to follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation structure, which is a systematic approach to technical documentation authoring. The only exception it [development documentation](../development) which we choose not to be part of the Diátaxis structure, but it is a common part of the software documentation.

Documentation isn’t just one thing, it is made up of four different parts which include — Tutorials, How-to guides, Explanations, and References.

|              | [Tutorials](../tutorials) | [How-to guides](../guides) | [References](../reference) | [Explanations](../explanations) |
|--------------|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:------------:|
