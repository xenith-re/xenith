    <h1>Xenith</h1>
    <p>
        Xenith is a lightweight Xen-based hypervisor designed for research and development in the realm of operating systems and virtualization. It provides a very stealth environment, advanced debugging capabilities, including low-level insights into guest systems and support for virtual machine introspection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Built with performance and stealth in mind, Xenith ensures minimal overhead for seamless execution of virtualized workloads. Its intuitive GUI simplifies management and monitoring, while a robust scripting API enables developers to automate tasks and extend functionality with ease.
